## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, Tailwind CSS and conditional rendering played a significant role in shaping the UI. Below are specific challenges related to these technologies and how they were addressed:

### 1. Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS

#### Challenge:

Ensuring a seamless responsive design using Tailwind CSS across various screen sizes and devices presented challenges, especially with complex layouts.

#### Solution:

Leveraged Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes and breakpoints to create a fluid and adaptive design. This involved customizing styles for different screen sizes and optimizing the layout for both desktop and mobile views.

### 2. Conditional Rendering for Mobile View

#### Challenge:

Implementing conditional rendering to adapt components based on the device type (e.g., desktop or mobile) introduced complexities in maintaining code readability and ensuring consistent behavior.

#### Solution:

Utilized conditional rendering techniques in React to conditionally render components based on the screen size. This involved using state variables and the `window.innerWidth` property to dynamically adjust the UI components.

### 3. Styling Consistency with Tailwind CSS

#### Challenge:

Ensuring styling consistency and adhering to the project's design system while using Tailwind CSS across multiple components proved to be a challenge.

#### Solution:

Established a set of reusable Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom styles to maintain a consistent design language. This approach enhanced code maintainability and made it easier to manage the overall styling of the application.
